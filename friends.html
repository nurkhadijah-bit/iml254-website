        <p>I won’t give away her full name due to privacy, but I’ve always called her iffah! We met each other during the first week of high school orientation. 
        My first impression towards her is that she’s friendly— main reason because she was the one who approached me first. Since then, 
        we’ve became friends, and then we became close friends during the lockdown. Our friendship at the beginning was not so great, 
        there has been ups and down but I believed that reason made our bond in friendship became even stronger than before :)
        I would not trade our friendship over anything else <del>kind of cringe but it’s true.<del></p>

    <h2>&#127801Athirah&#127801</h2>
    <img src="images/Athirah.jpg" alt="Athirah">
    <p>I got to know her through Iffah <del>such a small world isn’t it</del>. Our first conversation starts in a Whatsapp group made by Iffah because we want to play
    games together. The three of us really loved game called Sky Children of The Light, but at that time I am not that close with her yet <i>(Thirah)</i>.
    Sky Children of The Light is an interactive game, meaning that certain quests needs help with other players to complete. Hence, we kept chatting with each 
    other in a Whatsapp group, asking to join the world to help with the quests, and we eventually became close! It was unexpected because now she has became 
    my close buddy from highschool until we entered university. I will always forever be grateful to Iffah because why? We became an awesome trio!!!!!</p>
